# TalkativeCortana
A small(really) tool to make words Cortana says more interesting.

For using you should put a UTF-8 txt file named "Texts" at C:\TCTexts.
Type sentences in the file and every line should contain only one sentence.
The length of the sentence is not limited but th ones too long may go wrong while showing.
The programme will automatically and randomly choose one to set in the registry.
Remember to restart explorer.exe to show the line in the search box.
You can restart by typing "Y" in the command form or do it manually.

TKS 4 using! Contact me @ yuyanglee@hwstudio.site.
